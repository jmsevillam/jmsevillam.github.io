introduction: |
  This space is done to put together all the codes and ideas I have been developing over the years.

  Now I want to focus myself on programming on different languages such as `python`, `C/C++` where I have now some experience, but also in others such as `Julia` and `Ruby` but with a scientific approach to it.

  It basically means that I want to apply all of this to practical physics projects. 

  Then, having this in mind, I'd like to go to some optimization/Parallelization techniques/tools such as

  - OpenMP
  - MPI
  - Cuda
  - Cython
  - Numba
